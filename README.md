# why_do_you

This is a project i am currently working on. The result should be an application that features a lock screen that opens when using a social media (and other) application.

The user must do the displayed task on the lock screen to continue and open the desired application. My goal is to not permit the usage of scial media, but make the user ask himself: " WHY DO YOU want to use ...".
